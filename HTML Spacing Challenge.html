<h1> Eght Line Poem</h1>
<h3>David Bowie</h3>
<p>
	The tactful <span style= "color:green;font-weight:bold">cactus</span> by your window<br>
	Surveys the prairie of your room<br>
	The mobile spins to its collision<br>
	Clara puts her head between her paws<br>
	Open shops down West side<br>
	Will all the cacti find a home<br>
	But the key to the city<br>
	Is in the sun that pins the branches to the sky, &nbsp;oh-oh<br>
	&copy; etc, etc, etc.

<h1>A Dream Within a Dream</h1>
<h3>Edgar Alllan Poe</h3>
<p>
Take this kiss upon the brow!<br>
And, in parting from you now,<br>
Thus much let me avow-<br>
You are not wrong, who deem<br>
That my days have been a dream;<br>
Yet if hope has flown away<br>
In a night, or in a day,<br>
In a vision, or in none,<br>
Is it therefore the less gone?<br>
All that we see or seem<br>
Is but a dream within a dream.<br><br>

I stand amid the roar<br>
Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
And I hold within my hand<br>
Grains of the golden sand-<br>
How few! yet how they creep<br>
Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
While I weep- while I weep!<br>
O God! can I not grasp<br>
Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
O God! can I not save<br>
One from the pitiless wave?<br>
Is all that we see or seem<br>
But a dream within a dream?<br>
&copy; etc, etc, etc.
